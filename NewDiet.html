    <h1>Follow this diet for weightloss success!</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>This diet emphasizes smaller, leaner meals throughout the day for 
	digestive and heart health, and should be used in combination with 
	regular cardiovascular exercise.</p>
	<section>
	<ul>
	  <li>A lean diet has a greater impact on weight loss than exercise alone.</li>
	  <li>Remember, it's easier for your digestive system to have 5-6 smaller meals 
	  per day than 3 big ones. You're less likely to overeat between meals, as well.</li>
	  <li>Eat snacks only if hungry, and only foods high in water content or protein.</li>
	  <li>It's okay to treat yourself, and reward yourself with goodies, as long as it's 
	  not every day and doesn't become something you depend on for emotional relief. You can 
	  try replacing frequent sugary or salty snacks with fruit or nuts.</li>
	  <li>Calories should come from healthy, low-saturated-fat foods with high protein or 
	  complex carbohydrates, like lean meat or vegetables, fruits, or whole grains.</li>
	  <li>Don't be afraid of good fats, like omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids! Egg whites, 
	  avocados, nuts, seeds, and legumes are all great sources of protein AND good fats!</li>
	  <li>Pair your new healthy diet with regular aerobic cardiovascular exercise, and try weight 
	  training with lower weights and more reps! Don't overdo it with exercise, its better 
	  to start low and easy and build up and reduce the risk of injury or burn-out. Start twice a 
	  week and build yourself up gradually to 3 or 4 days a week. This process should take 3-4 
	  months, so don't rush it. Seek out a good personal trainer if you're unsure where to start!</li>
	  <li>Remember to appreciate and love yourself every day. This is about feeling good 
	  and improving longevity and quality of life, not about your inherent value. You're 
	  already fantastic!</li>
