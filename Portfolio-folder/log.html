      <p>A fairly gross misappropriation of this quote, but it applies to any endeaver. I started learning Java a 
	  week ago and decided I want to work on front-end development as well. I've dabbled with HTML, Python, as well 
	  as other high-end OOP languages like C++, at various times in my life but I want to dedicate myself to mastering 
	  the language and becoming comfortable building complex websites, including CSS and JavaScript.<br><br>

      I also want to explore and at least familiarize myself with cyber security and network administration. <br><br>

      I expect this jounrey to take the better part of the next decade to become proficient enough in several areas of 
	  programming and computer science to find steady employment.
